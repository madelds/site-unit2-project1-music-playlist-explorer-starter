### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics discussed in my labs helped prepare me to complete the assignment. The features in my weekly assignment which I felt unprepared to complete included the functions involving DOM manipulation.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have spent more time implementing stretch features and interactive designs to my home and featured pages. I definitely would have addded the additional feature of "deleting" a playlist.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Reflecting on my project demo, I would say that my collaboration with peers went well, while my time management did not go as planned. Something I would like to do that my peer did is to use more outside resources to help me build my project.
